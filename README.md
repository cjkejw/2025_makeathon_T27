## 🏆 Project: aWARE - Collision Avoidance for Warehouse Safety  

### 📌 Overview  
aWARE is a **collision detection and warning system** designed to prevent workplace accidents in warehouses. Our system leverages **computer vision and real-time alerts** to **detect humans and obstacles** in warehouse environments, reducing the risk of accidents, injuries, and costly damages.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
**How might we enable warehouse handling equipment to avoid collisions in crowded or tight spaces to ensure worker safety and prevent property damage?**  

- In 2022, **3.2 serious injury cases per 100 workers** were recorded in warehouse environments.  
- **Millions of dollars in damages** occur annually due to warehouse accidents.  

Our system aims to tackle this by providing **real-time detection and alerts**.

## 💡 Solution: aWARE  
### 🏗️ Prototype Features  
- **Human Detection with YOLOv8** 🧍‍♂️  
  - Detects warehouse personnel and obstacles with high accuracy.  
- **Motion Detection:** Recognizes movement by comparing frames.  
- **Real-Time Alerts:**  
  - 🚨 **LED & Buzzer Alerts** for drivers and pedestrians.  
  - 📟 **LCD Display Notifications** for quick responses.  

---

## 🔬 Tech Stack  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – High-speed object detection  
- **Python (OpenCV, Ultralytics)** – Image processing
- **Arduino** (Sensor integration for alert system)  

---

## 🔮 Future Plans  
- 🔍 **AI Model Enhancement:** Incorporate latest AI models for improved detection.  
- 🌌 **Infrared Sensors:** Enable detection in low-light environments.  
- 💼 **Business Integration:** Subscription plans with a **3-month trial** for warehouses.  

---

## 📢 Marketing & Impact
